    \caption{\textbf{Analysis of Mass-Related Assumptions in Model Responses.} 
    For each model, we analyze responses to problems that explicitly require determining stellar masses as an intermediate step or final answer (122 problems). 
    The percentages show what fraction of each category (incorrect/correct) contained explicit mass assumptions. 
    Mass assumptions were identified by searching for the following patterns: center-of-mass calculation ``(df['star1\_x'] + df['star2\_x'])/2'', 
    explicit mass assignments (``star1\_mass = 1.0'', ``star2\_mass = 1.0'', ``m1 = m2'', ``m1 = 1.0'', ``m2 = 1.0''), 
    and other variations of unit mass assumptions. All matches were manually verified. 
    Results averaged over 3 runs with standard errors shown.}\label{tab:mass_assumptions}
